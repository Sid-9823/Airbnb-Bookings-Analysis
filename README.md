* **How much does a unit cost on average in each neighborhood group ?**

* **What are the top ten neighborhoods with the most Airbnb units ?**

* **What are the top ten neighborhoods with the lowest number of Airbnb units?**

* **What are the top ten most affordable neighborhoods?**

* **What are the top ten most expensive neighborhoods?**

* **Which room type is most prevalent in each neighborhood?**

* **Who are the top ten hosts in New York City ?**

* **What effect does pricing have on the number of reviews ?**

Even though Airbnb does not own any real estate, it produced $8.4 billion in income in 2022. Now, they aim to join the hotel sector starting with their first hotel in New York City under the brand name, 'Airbnb Stay'. As a result, we will do a complete Exploratory Data Analysis on current Airbnb units to give management solutions that are both affordable and lucrative.

<H2>Project Summary</H2>

<H3>Data collection</H3>

* In the early stages of this project, we loaded and collected our data, stored it in the data frame, and performed some basic analysis like checking out shape, dimensions, etc.

<H3>EDA</H3>

* ***In the EDA part, we performed analysis to deep-dive into underlying insights by using various types of plots.***

* ***While performing EDA, we found out:***
 
 * ***Manhattan has the highest number of Airbnb apartments, followed by Brooklyn.***

 * ***Unit costs are highest in Manhattan, followed by Brooklyn and Staten Island.***

 * ***Lowest unit cost is in the Bronx.***

 * ***Williamsburg has the highest number of Airbnb units, followed by Bedford and Harlem.***

 * ***Willowbrook, Woodrow, Fort Wadsworth, Rosville, New Dorp, and Richmondtown only have one unit, while the rest four have two units.***

 * ***Among the top 10 cheap neighborhood Airbnb units, Bull's Head, Hunt's Point, and Tremont units are the cheapest.***

 * ***Among the top 10 most expensive neighborhood Airbnb units, Upper West Side, Greenpoint, and Astoria units are the most expensive, followed by the Lower East Side and East Harlem.***
 
 * ***In Manhattan, the majority of the units are either entire homes or apartment types, followed by private room types.***

 * ***In Brooklyn, the number of private room units is slightly higher as compared to apartments or entire homes.***

 * ***Shared room units are very few in all of the neighborhood groups.***

 * ***Among all hosts, Michael and David are hosting the most Airbnb units, followed by Sonder, John, Alex, and several others.***

 * ***There are more reviews for the price range of 0 - 500$.***

 * ***Review starts decreasing as prices go up, which means more customers prefer affordable stays.***

 * ***In Manhattan, hosts prefer a minimum stay of around 8 days.***

 * ***In Brooklyn, hosts prefer a minimum stay of around 6 days.***

 * ***In Queens, hosts prefer a minimum stay of around 5 days.***
